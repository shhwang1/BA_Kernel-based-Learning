## Purpose of Tutorial
There are data with binary classes and data with various classes in the world. Finding a classifier that perfectly distinguishes classes for these data is a key task in classification problems. However, it is a very difficult problem to find linear classifiers just for data with binary classes, not to mention multi-class data. This tutorial contains the contents of kernel-based learning for the purpose of discovering the classifier. In this tutorial, support vector machine and support vector regression are described as the methodology of kernel-base learning. In addition, various hyperparameters are adjusted for various datasets, and analysis of experimental results is the main content. The table of contents is as follows.
